# 👋 Hi, I'm Geraldi Aditya

I’m a **Flutter Developer** passionate about clean UI & smooth UX — now diving into **Backend Engineering with Go (Golang)**. I enjoy crafting beautiful mobile experiences and building scalable backend systems with a focus on performance and maintainability.

## 💼 What I Do

- 📱 **Flutter Developer** since 2023 — building efficient, maintainable, and delightful apps.
- ⚙️ Learning and building backend systems with **Golang** (REST APIs, gRPC, microservices).
- 📦 Experienced in developing **custom Odoo ERP modules** to automate business processes.
- 💻 Brief exposure to **Laravel** during university — built an academic project for my thesis.
- 🧠 Curious about software architecture, performance optimization, and developer workflows.
